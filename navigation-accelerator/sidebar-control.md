# Navigation Accelerator - Sidebar Control

The Navigation Accelerator plays a pivotal role in controlling and organizing the sidebar navigation of your application. In this document, we'll delve into how it manages and configures the sidebar structure, ensuring a user-friendly and intuitive navigation experience.

## Sidebar Configuration

The sidebar structure is defined using a structured JSON object. Here's an excerpt of this configuration:

```json
[
  {
    "items": [
      {
        "icon": "Home",
        "path": "/",
        "label": "Home",
        "expanded": false,
        "subitems": []
      }
    ],
    "identifier": "top"
  },
  {
    "items": [
      {
        "icon": "Widgets",
        "path": "/module-a",
        "label": "Module A",
        "expanded": false,
        "subitems": []
      },
      {
        "icon": "Widgets",
        "path": "/module-b",
        "label": "Module B",
        "expanded": false,
        "subitems": []
      },
      {
        "icon": "Widgets",
        "path": "/module-c",
        "label": "Module C",
        "expanded": false,
        "subitems": []
      }
    ],
    "identifier": "middle"
  },
  // ...
]
```

**Key Elements:**

- Each sidebar section is represented as an object within the array.
- The `items` property contains an array of sidebar items, each with properties like `icon`, `path`, `label`, `expanded`, and `subitems`.
- The `identifier` is a unique identifier for each section.

The sidebar configuration defines the hierarchy of navigation elements, their labels, and links.
